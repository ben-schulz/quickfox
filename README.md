## What Are Words?

They are always relative. Often, they are defined relative to other words. This project attempts to construct a human-usable interface for tracing the textual relations that give rise to these meanings, and then writing them out in a machine-readable format, so that subjective, human-directed ideas can be explored with computational tools.
